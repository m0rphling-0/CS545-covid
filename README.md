# Predicting Covid Cases with VAR

This repo is a collection of functions and data I used for my portion of 
a project exploring the possibility of predicting daily new Covid Cases
using the data provided by Johns Hopkins University at:

https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data

I used the VAR implementation provided by the stats models library with middling results.
